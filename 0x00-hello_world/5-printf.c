Here is a C program that prints exactly "with proper grammar, but the outcome is a piece of art," followed by a new line character using the `printf` function:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
	    printf("with proper grammar, but the outcome is a piece of art,\n");
	        return (0);
}
```

This program uses the `printf` function to print the string "with proper grammar, but the outcome is a piece of art," followed by a new line character. The `return (0)` statement at the end of the program ensures that it ends with the value 0. To compile this program without warnings when using the `-Wall` gcc option, you can include the following line at the beginning of your program:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
```

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.
